inherently//The int assembly language instruction is inherently slow because it performs several
consistency and security checks.

fictitious//ramdisk (a fictitious block device kept in RAM)

elaborate//However, polling applied to I/O operations is usually more elaborate, because the driver must also remember to check for possible time-outs.

drastically/To provide a drastically simple solution to synchronization problems, some traditional Unix kernels are nonpreemptive: when a process executes in Kernel Mode, it cannot be arbitrarily suspended and substituted with another process.

relinquish/Of course, a process in Kernel Mode can voluntarily relinquish the CPU, but in this case, it must ensure that all data structures are left in a consistent state.
